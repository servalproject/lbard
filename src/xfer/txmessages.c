Serval Low-bandwidth asychronous Rhizome Demonstrator.
Copyright (C) 2015 Serval Project Inc.

This program monitors a local Rhizome database and attempts
to synchronise it over low-bandwidth declarative transports, 
such as bluetooth name or wifi-direct service information
messages.  It is intended to give a high priority to MeshMS
converations among nearby nodes.

The design is fully asynchronous, so a call to the update_my_message()
function from time to time should be all that is required.

  /* There are a few possible options here.
     1. We have no peers. In which case, there is little point doing anything.
        EXCEPT that some people might be able to hear us, even though we can't
	hear them.  So we should walk through a prioritised ordering of some subset
	of bundles, presenting them in turn via the interface.
     2. We have peers, but we have no content addressed to them, that we have not
        already communicated to them.
        In which case, we act as for (1) above.
     3. We have peers, and have bundles addressed to one or more of them, and have
        not yet heard from those peers that they already have those bundles. In which
        case we should walk through presenting those bundles repeatedly until the
        peers acknowledge the receipt of those bundles.

	Thus we need to keep track of the bundles that other peers have, and that have
	been announced to us.

	We also need to take care to announce MeshMS bundles, and especially new and
	updated MeshMS bundles that are addressed to our peers so that MeshMS has
	minimal latency over the transport.  In other words, we don't want to have to
	wait hours for the MeshMS bundle in question to get announced.

	Thus we need some sense of "last announcement time" for bundles so that we can
	prioritise them.  This should be kept with the bundle record.  Then we can
	simply lookup the highest priority bundle, see where we got to in announcing
	it, and announce the next piece of it.

	We should probably also announce a BAR or two, so that peers know if we have
	received bundles that they are currently sending.  Similarly, if we see a BAR
	from a peer for a bundle that they have already received, we should reduce the
	priority of sending that bundle, in particular if the bundle is addressed to
	them, i.e., we have confirmation that the recipient has received the bundle.

	Finally, we should use network coding so that recipients can miss some messages
	without terribly upsetting the whole thing, unless the transport is known to be
	reliable.
